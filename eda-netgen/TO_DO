TO_DO list for version 1.5
------------------------------

 As of version 1.5.70, the major to-do item list is complete.

Possible useful additions (not critical)
----------------------

 1) Add automatic file format guessing from file extension for "write" command
 2) Incorporate into Tcl-based xcircuit
 3) Extend 2-terminal device handling (namely R and C) to more formats
    (where appropriate).
 4) Generate feedback in the form of a .mag file to facilitate interactive
    netlist comparison in conjunction with magic.  This may be an error
    file, but it may also make use of magic 7.2's "element" command to
    build rat's nests or outline areas of interest or anything else that
    might be helpful to interactive comparison.
 5) Handle the hierarchy of ".ext" files automatically.
 6) Retain position information from ".ext" files for the purpose of writing
    feedback information into magic and for matching devices in the element
    list to their counterparts in the original layout [note---done for .sim
    format, which contains position information.  Usefulness of improving
    the .ext parsing is questionable.  Ditto for item 8].
 7) Expand upon the details of format-to-format translation, (especially
    ntk and ext formats, SPICE format writing, and sim format reading).
 8) Add a "subcircuit" command to mimic a SPICE ".SUBCKT ... .ENDS" card
    (i.e., the ability to add subcircuit "stub" definitions from the
    command line or from a setup file).
