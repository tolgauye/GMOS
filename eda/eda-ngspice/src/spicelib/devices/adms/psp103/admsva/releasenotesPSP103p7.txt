Usage
-----

Depending which model one wants to use, one should compile one of the four .va-files
(psp103.va, psp103t.va, psp103_nqs.va, and juncap200.va). The module names are
"PSP103VA", "PSP103TVA", and "PSPNQS103VA" (for QS, self heating, and NQS,
respectively), and "JUNCAP200" for the JUNCAP2-model.
